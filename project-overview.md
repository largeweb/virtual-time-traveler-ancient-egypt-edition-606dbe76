# Project Overview

Project Name: Virtual Time Traveler: Ancient Egypt Edition

Description: A web application that simulates an immersive journey into Ancient Egypt. Users step into the sandals of a young scribe in Thebes during the reign of Hatshepsut, exploring the city, interacting with characters, and experiencing daily life. All backend features mocked.

Features:
*   Interactive Map: A beautifully designed map of Thebes with key locations (temple, marketplace, Nile riverfront) that users can "travel" to.
*   Dialogue Simulations: Engaging conversations with key figures (priests, merchants, other scribes) using mocked AI-driven dialogue trees. User choices impact the simulated story.
*   Historical Object Exploration: Virtual "inspections" of artifacts (papyrus scrolls, pottery, jewelry) with descriptive text and interactive elements.
*   Time-Period Authentic UI: A user interface designed to evoke the aesthetics of Ancient Egypt (hieroglyph-inspired fonts, earthy color palettes).

Target Audience: History enthusiasts, students, educators, and anyone curious about Ancient Egypt.

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
